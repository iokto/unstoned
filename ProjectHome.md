The Touchstone(TM) format is a standard ascii format for presenting RF and microwave network measurement/simulation results. This tool will allow the user to plot or convert Touchstone(TM) files.

Plotting options will include standard amplitude/phase plots and an option to extrapolate the data for linear networks.

Unstoned will allow conversion from a set of 2 port measured data to 4 port models as well as exporting to spreadsheets.
